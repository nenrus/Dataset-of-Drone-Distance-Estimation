This dataset consists of 227 images of DJI Air 2S drone taken for distance estimation. 
The images are classified based on the distance when the camera took the picture. 
It is grouped into three categories train 60%, valid 20%, and test 20% for the purpose of YOLO training.
Also, there are annotation files that represent the location of the drone and its bounding box in the image using YOLO v8 format.

The dataset is used for distance estimation research that is submitted to the US-Europe Air Transportation Research & Development Symposium 2025.
